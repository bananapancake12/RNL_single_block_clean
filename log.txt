list: original list
list2: list without linear terms
list3: from run5 with rewritten code around target modes

matlab output1,2,3 corresponds to the same thing

output 4: for full convolution
output 5: for physical space 

------------ fixes in symmetry --------------

output 6: after fixes in symmetry

(list and list2 now removed)

list: now a big list with very low thresholds


new output: current threshold solution
output 2: full convolution for ~50 steps
output 3: blown up simulation with threshold of 3e-7

output 7: list with high threshold to look at effect of band difference

---------- hopefully correct code (wednesday) -----------

output 8: threshold 3e-6 with hopefully correct code

temp and temp2: blow up simulation for 3e-6 with different interface heights

output : one snapshot from csd3 full advection calc
2: low threshold
3: very high threshold
4: very high threshold with low cfl


--------- restart ------------- (16/7)

15: normal dns
1: normal but without 64th? idk
2: 8e-6 threshold, blowing up....
